# TODO 


# NOTE: wfw find the wrench feasible workspace of the cable system at a give configuration.
#    Tmax is the maximum cable tension, Tmax should be a nJ dimensional
#    vector;
#    JcT is the transpose of cable Jacobian: JcT*T=U;
#    JeT is the transpose of end effector Jacobian: JeT*Fe=U;
#    G is the gravity vector, G should be a nJ dimensional vector.
