# TODO: Understand the concept


# NOTE: this file calcuate the cable jacobians 
#   nBody denotes the number of bodies.
#   TransM is 4n by 4 matrix of transformation
#   CableSeg denote each segment of cable, in the format of:
#   [ CableID  Pt1  Pt2; ...];
#   CableID is the id of the Cable, Pt1 & Pt2 is the index in CbRtPtCrd and CbRtPtBdId.
